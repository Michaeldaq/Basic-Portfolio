			<p> I am a huge geek. I enjoy comics, video games, movies, technology, and music pretty much anything that is considered some form of entertainment. I currently work at a pizza place as a Manager/ Delivery driver. I got into coding to give myself an oppertunity to get out of the pizza shop and towards something that intersts me more. Originally I went to School for Computer Information and Technology however I took a year hiatus and just worked full time. Now that I am dying to go back to school and get out of the unforgiving heat of a kitchen in Florida's summer I hope that I follow everyhting as good as I can to make sure that I don't have to go back to the kitchen  when summer rolls around again</p>
